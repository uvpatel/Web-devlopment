# HTML Block Elements
You already know about HTML inline elements. All HTML tags have specific display behavior: they are either block-level elements or inline elements.

## What are Block-level Elements?

Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.

### Characteristics of Block-level Elements:
- Always start on a new line.
- Take up the full width available.
- Width and height can be controlled via CSS.
- Can contain other block-level as well as inline elements.
