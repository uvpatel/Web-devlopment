# Horizontal Line Tag
To add a horizontal line in your HTML document, the `<hr>` tag comes in handy.

## How to use the `<hr>` tag?
The syntax of the hr tag looks something like this.

```html
<hr>
```

The `<hr>` tag is an empty or self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag. It serves as a visual separator, dividing different sections of your document with a horizontal line.
