# Paragraph Tag
To create well-structured text in your HTML document, the `<p>` tag is essential for defining paragraphs.

## `<p>` Tag: Defining a Paragraph in HTML
The `<p>` tag is used to format text into distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph element is separated by automatic empty line spaces above and below the content, providing a clear visual separation. The tag must be closed with its corresponding `</p>` tag.
```html
<p>
  <!-- Paragraph content -->
</p>
```

## Attributes and Styling
While the `<p>` tag is straightforward, you can enhance its functionality using various attributes like class or id for CSS styling. You can also include inline styles using the style attribute.
```html
<p class="example" style="color: blue;">
  This is a styled paragraph.
</p>
```

## Best Practices
It's advisable to use the `<p>` tag for textual content and not for layout control. For layout purposes, consider using HTML5 semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, or CSS techniques.

Don't worry, we will look into semantic tags and other techniques later in this tutorial. Here is how you can create a paragraph in HTML:
