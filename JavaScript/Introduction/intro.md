# JS Introduction

> Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the bricks and walls that give it structure. CSS is like the paint and decorations that make it look nice. But without JavaScript, the house won't have any lights or running water—nothing would work or move.

> JavaScript is what makes a website interactive. It's like adding electricity to the house. It lets you click buttons to open doors, turn on lights, or even play music. So, without JavaScript, a website would be like a house where nothing really happens—you could look at it. The video below shows a modal which is created using JavaScript.

> JavaScript is used for frontend programming but it is also used for backend programming using Node.js. Let's take a step back and understand all these concepts one by one.

## What is Programming?
> It is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English, or Bengali can be used to talk to a human but for computers, we need straightforward instructions.

> Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

> Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. It involves the use of programming languages and various tools to create software programs that can be run on a computer or other devices.
