# Heading Tags

In HTML, heading tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>` are used to define the structure and layout of text on a web page. These tags help create a hierarchical organization of content, making it easier for both users and [search engines to understand the page's content](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/heading-tags-for-seo/341817/).

The `<h1>` tag is generally used for the main title and is the largest and most prominent, while `<h2>` to `<h6>` tags are used for subheadings, further subheadings and so on. Proper use of heading tags not only improves the readability of a web page but also optimizes it for search engine ranking in Google.

## `<h1>` **Tag: First-Level Heading`**
The <h1> tag defines the first-level heading and is typically the largest and boldest among all the heading tags. It is often used for the main title of the page.
```html
<h1>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h1>
```
## <`h2>` **Tag: Second-Level Heading**`
The <h2> tag is used for second-level headings and is slightly smaller than the <h1> tag. This is commonly used for section titles.
```html
<h2>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h2>
```
## `<h3>` **Tag: Third-Level Heading**
The `<h3>` tag is used for third-level headings. These are smaller than `<h2>` tags and are often used for sub-sections within an `<h2>` section.
```html
<h3>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h3>
```
## `<h4>` **Tag: Fourth-Level Heading**
The `<h4>` tag defines a fourth-level heading, which is smaller than the `<h3>` tag. It's often used for sub-sections within an `<h3>` section.

```html
<h4>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h4>
```

## `<h5>` **Tag:Fifth-Level Heading**

The `<h5>` tag is used for fifth-level headings and is smaller than `<h4>`tags. These are rarely used but can be helpful for deeply nested sections.

```html
<h5>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h5>
```
## `<h6>` **Tag: Sixth-Level Heading**
The `<h6>` tag defines the sixth-level heading and is the smallest among all the heading tags. It's rarely used but can serve specific formatting needs.
```html
<h6>
  <!-- Heading content -->
</h6>
```
